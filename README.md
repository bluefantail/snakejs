# snakejs

snake js is a simple snake-style game written purely in javascript, for fun. It's not intended to be perfectly cross-browser compatible though reasonable attempt will be made to do so. Mostly a personal project to get my head around working with javascript more.

For ease of development and testing, I've bundled it with a gemfile containing jekyll so people can get it running in a browser quickly. 

### Installation

Clone snakejs to your machine and run:

```
$ bundle install
```

After Jekyll is installed run:

```
$ jekyll serve
```

And snakejs should be available at http://localhost:4000
